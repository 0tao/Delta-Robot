h1. Delta Robot - A kinematic linkage robot for students

This is a scale model of a Delta robot.  They are typically used for pick-and-place jobs on assembly lines.
A perfect example is a machine that takes candy bars from an assembly line and packs them into boxes without
contaminating the "food".  There's also the Rostock, a 3D printer that puts the print head on a Delta Robot.
Here are some questions you can answer with this robot:

Why are parallelograms useful?
What are coordinate systems?
What is vector math, and how do I use it?
How do I write programs for Arduino?
How do I talk to an Arduino?
How do I move servos with an Arduino?
What are (Inverse and Forward) Kinematics?
What is a Work Envelope?

This robot works just as well upside down as right side up.
