h1. Delta Robot - A kinematic linkage robot for students

This is a small scale Delta robot.  They are typically used for pick-and-place jobs on assembly lines.
They are also common in the Rostock/Kossel style 3D printers.

This robot works just as well upside down as right side up.

h2. Notes

v1 is our original model made with hobby servos and 3D printed parts.  It is kept here for historical reasons.

v8 uses stepper motors and 2x Adafruit motor shield v2 for very high accuracy.
It also comes with a frame for easier setup and use.

Here are some questions you can answer with this robot:

Why are parallelograms useful?
What are coordinate systems?
What is vector math, and how do I use it?
How do I write programs for Arduino?
How do I talk to an Arduino?
How do I move servos with an Arduino?
What are (Inverse and Forward) Kinematics?
What is a Work Envelope?
